## Factorization Machines in Spark

This is an implementation of Factorization Machines based on Scala and Apache Spark. It actually uses stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as a learning method while training the model parameters. 

From http://libfm.org: 

> Factorization machines (FM) are a generic approach that allows to mimic most factorization models by feature engineering. This way, factorization machines combine the generality of feature engineering with the superiority of factorization models in estimating interactions between categorical variables of large domain.
